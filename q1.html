                <p>This form would not work on GitHub pages due to it only supports inactive content and the form action is attributed to a localhost address, hence "(http://localhost:3002/send/)", so it is not unrestricted from Github pages.</p>

                <h2>https://dry-bayou-18746.herokuapp.com/send/</h2>
                <p>This form works on GitHub pages because it sustains HTTPS, which can make submissions to exterior servers. </p>
